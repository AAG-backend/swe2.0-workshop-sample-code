# Hashing: Securing passwords using Salting and Hashing

## Objectives - what are we going to learn today?

1. We are going to learn the differences between Encoding, Encryption, and Hashing
2. We are going to learn the typical flow of how a user logs in and how we determine if they provided the right password.
3. Demo hashing using crypto and bcrypt.


## Encoding

## Encryption

## Hashing


### How does hashing work

### From user input to database

## Salting 

### Crypto -> hashing

### Bcrypt -> hashing algorithm + salting
