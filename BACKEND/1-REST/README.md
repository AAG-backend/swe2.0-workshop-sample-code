## Objectives


-We are going to talk about what exactly is REST, what is a RESTful API, and what makes an api RESTful?

-Code spelunking 
    -What are some important information we should know?
    -Can you identify the seed data, models, study whatâ€™s in the server, basically just familiarize yourself with the codebase. While you are doing that, I will be setting up the demo via vs code as it is a lot cleaner to follow on.
